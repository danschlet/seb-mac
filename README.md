Safe Exam Browser for iOS 9.3.5 and newer

Open SafeExamBrowser.xcodeproj in a recent version of Xcode. For building you have to switch off code signing or add your own code signing identities. SEB uses the com.apple.developer.edu-assessment-mode entitlement, which needs to be requested from Apple for your developer team.

The last iOS version (2.1.17) still compatible with iOS 9.3.5 is archived in this branch.

All information about Safe Exam Browser you'll find at http://safeexambrowser.org, especially see https://safeexambrowser.org/developer/overview.html. Other documentation is available in the according repositories. Search discussions boards if you don't find information in the manual and SEB How To document (see links on page Support).

For your information: The correct way how to spell SEB for user-facing text is all three letters in CAPS. If you find SEB written as seb in code, then that's ok if it's some symbol users will never see. If you find SEB written as Seb, then that is definitely WRONG.
